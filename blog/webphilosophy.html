<h1>We Should Embrace The Web And Bun Is A Mistake</h1>
<h3>3 October 2023</h2>
<br><br>
<p>When I first started learning programming which is roughly in the start of 2018, Deno and Bun didn't exist. Crypto was not popular and AI was far less powerful; It was a different world.</p>
<p>I have gotten interested in web development only recently but my first experience with it probably dates back to 2018 too, I didn't know much about HTTP back then and didn't even know what frameworks were.</p>
<p>It stayed that way for a long time but in that long time I did create websites and I made a lot of different ones without frameworks. You can make websites without frameworks and for simple websites you should, I am not saying anything about that but what if frameworks didn't exist? What if Ryan never invented Deno and Jarred never created invented Bun? Let's just imagine that which doesn't have any potential.</p>
<p>Or does it? The rest of this blog post will be about exploring a world that never could have any pratical websites and a world without potential, that sounds cringe honestly but that is what many people will think in a less exaggerated manner but I will PROVE that we can create websites without ever needing frameworks and for you React programmers that does not include React.</p>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<p>Okay so you might be asking a pretty important question: without frameworks, wouldn't we have a lot of boilerplate? As valid as that is, I said removing frameworks but that doesn't mean we cannot combat boilerplate. To show you the true nature of the web, let's have an example where we need to make beautiful UI for a website. "But without Svelte's beautiful markup how could we do this?". We use pure JavaScript's best feature #1™: custom tags. See we can define a custom tag "nicebutton" for a nice button and use this to combat boilerplate using pure JavaScript without any frameworks, people can even make their own collection of custom tags which would not be frameworks but still a genius replacement.</p>
<p>But that is only JavaScript's best feature #1™, "Okay but what about reactivity like in Svelte?". I introduce JavaScript's best feature #2™: Manually manipulating the DOM. "Huh? How? WHAT?". Indeed, see manually manipulating the DOM will not only make it easier to keep track (Svelte 5 kinda fixes that but it's not even released yet) and it gives you way more control then anything like Svelte will give you. Manually manipulating the DOM is what the world wide web was meant for, content which YOU add, delete or modify. Frameworks take that control of adding, deleting and modifying from you in one sense. So great but how do we listen for stuff and then manipulate the DOM based on that stuff, well events of course.</p>
<p>Great but there is one last component, "how do I do the complicated stuff?". Well try to not. If your app is big and huge then sure go with frameworks but even if you have a bit of doubt then go with vanilla, stop those hundreds of hundreds of lines of frameworks in your dependicies that are useless for your app. You don't need them. Web apps were invented so clients don't need to store much data but now we have solved that problem so what about servers not needing to store much data? That sounds like a reasonable goal. Most of this blog post really has been a more philosophical look then actually providing solutions, it's been a guideline for me and other developers to work towards. I learned Svelte recently and it's a good framework but for a lot of my apps I haven't been using it because I don't need it, that doesn't mean I will never use it. Think of Flask, it's not that big, only a few files and being pretty simple but I can make a lot of stuff with it. That sounds good for small apps, right? Now let's switch to Bun, the GitHub repo has like a thousand folders and a thousand files in each folder, it is giant. That leads me too...</p>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<p><strong>Bun is a mistake.</strong> It has every possible thing baked into one gigantic repo and nothing else then that. Let's list what tools Bun offers:</p>
<ul>
	<li>JavaScript runtime</li>
	<li>Package manager</li>
	<li>Test runner</li>
	<li>Standard library</li>
	<li>Bundler</li>
	<li>TypeScript compiler</li>
	<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>The amount of things Bun has baked into it is INSANE and makes it GIGANTIC. There are so many articles saying "Bun is the next big thing!" and the hype that is being build around Bun is nothing, it's just hype and nothing else. Bun also is a massive ecosystem split and WE are not going to adjust to it. At the end of the day Bun is just a replacement for all the tools you already use but faster but speed is just one thing that doesn't mean everything, there were way better ways to accomplish speed then Bun which I don't have enough time to go over here. Bun is NOT a drop-in replacement for Node.js so it basically doesn't even accomplish it's goal. Also Bun's tester is comparing against other testers, Bun's package manager is comparing against npm but npm is a package manager for Node which is not exactly Node itself and Bun is comparing against bundlers. A lot of articles compare Bun against Node but that's only a small part of the picture so I ask those articles to compare Bun against other tools too. Bun just has multiple problems, I don't think it's a completely lost cause though as contradictory as that might sound. Bun was made in good faith and the people who made it are talented but even with the most talented people you cannot polish a turd so I think the goal of Bun is a good one but how Bun does it is bad. Thanks for reading this long blog post.</p>
